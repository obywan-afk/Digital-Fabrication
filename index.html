            <h1>Week 1</h1>
            <h2>Ideation phase</h2>

            <p>For me, the printed design should be something which does not get trashed afterwards.
            I am currently thinking about combining multiple projects or old projects of mine to create something new.
            I am particularly interested in creating something for my room that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional.
            One idea that I had was to incorporate the golden (Fibonacci) ratio into the design.</p>
            <h3>Old project reusability</h3>
            <p>One old project of mine was an internet alarm that I programmed using Python and cronjobs on a Raspberry Pi. 
              The system further uses a 25W class D amplifier with a speaker connected to the Raspberry Pi.
              The alarm would play my favorite internet radio at a low volume, gradually increasing as the alarm went off.
              I like waking up to music or light, rather than a blaring alarm, so I thought it would be nice to continue working on this project.</p>
            <h3>Connection with Study</h3>
            <p>During my master's studies in Paris-Saclay, 
              I learned about the potential of tangible devices 
              and I thought about ways to implement this.</p>
            <h3>Novelity</h3>
            <p>I thought about creating a clock that would be 3D printed.
              The clock should be able to meet all the requirements of the class but could be extended.
              I considered different design patterns for my room and eventually settled on a circular design.
              A 3D printed ball with a magnet (or similiar) could be used to create a cirucit which would allow the system to turn on or off an alarm. 
              By placing the ball on different times on the watch, a new alarm could be set. This would make it less static and interactive. 
              The GPIO pins could be used for additional logic (possible shift register required)
              ( further a light and display with a weather indication could be added)
              ( maybe even a small mirror)</p>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <p>Setting up enviroment.
              Installing out GitLab. 
              Installing Sharp3D.
              Installing Prusa Slicer. 
              During the first week, I also got introduced to the 3D printer and how it works.
              I started to think about what I could create with the 3D printer and came up with the idea of creating a decorative piece for my room.
              Here's a link to two files which I created during my ideation phase:
              3D printer inspiration file
              Desing iteration

            <h1>Week 2</h1>
            <h2>Design Proces</h2>
            <p>I evaluated different designs and eventually stumbled upon the "flower of life" pattern, which incorporates the Fibonacci ratio.
            </p>
            <p>I realized that the printer can only print 20cm x 20cm, so a classic flower of life design would be too small. To cover the 1m^2 with this design a circle size of 40cm x 40cm would be required.
            </p>
            <h3>First print results</h3>
            Thickness was chosen for 0.55mm, this thickness still yielded good quality while being the fastest to print with only 3 layers on 0.2mm
            Here are some images of our progress this week:

            <h1>Week 4</h1>
            <h2>Re-design</h2>
            <p>Although there were strikes I was able to get some testing prints done. 
              Part of my sessions was installing Prusa Slicer and setting it up.
              Prusa Slicer settings
              The connector design was printed and evaluated. It turned out that more padding than expected was necessary to make the arrow fit into the slots. Furthermore, the thickness of 1mm turned out to be more than necessary. 
              0.55mm prints were used which were three layers  consiting out of two 0.2mm and one 0.15mm layer.</p>

            <h1>Week 5</h1>
            <h2>Printing</h2>
            <p>Trying to print multiple arrows did not work too well. They often started to unwrinkle which got stuck to the printer and eventuaylly unstick the print.
              Sometimes this destroyed other pieces. The design was also changed to smoothen out sharp edges and also to create a small overlap between the prints.
              Also four holes were added to be able to wire wires through it.
